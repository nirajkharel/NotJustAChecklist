## Agenda
- We sometimes do not receive an APK file or Play Store link to perform an Android Pentest. It could be necessary for us to install it using a invitation link supplied on the work email.
- To install it from invititation, we first need to sign in with a work email on our device. It creates a separate work profile on the device which means a separate user id on the device.
- The way we use tools like adb, drozer and frida does not works in this profile. 
- Below notes explains how to perform pentest on an app when it is installed on a work profile.

## Work Account Addition
- Navigate to chrome or account section on your Settings.
- Add a google account 
- It shows something like below while setting up the account. You might need to get an approval from an administration while setting up an account.

- After an installation of work profile, install the necessary applications on a profile like chrome. It looks like.

## The problem
- Let us suppose we had installed an application Twitter through an invitation link.

**List Package through ADB**
```sh
adb shell pm list packages | grep -i twitter
```
-  We will not have any packages listed. We will also not be able to install the packages on work profile.

**Hook Application with Frida**
```sh
➜ frida -U -f com.twitter.android
     ____

Failed to spawn: unable to find application with identifier 'com.twitter.android'
```
- This might arise a problem during an assessment since we would not be able to pull the internal storage, pull an apk, hook the application's classes and methods.
- This is due to the tools like ADB and Frida use default User ID (which is 0)  on a device which is a personal profile.

## The Solution
- Since there will be different profiles, we can list the installed profiles/users using ADB.
```bash
➜ adb shell pm list users
Users:
	UserInfo{0:Owner:c13} running
	UserInfo{10:Work profile:1030} running
	UserInfo{999:XSpace:801030} running
```
- Here we can find an `User ID 10` for a Work Profile and we need to specify a specific User ID on the command.
```bash
➜ adb shell pm list packages --user 10 | grep -i twi
package:com.twitter.android
```

**Install APK to work profile with ADB**
- For this, we need to push an APK file into the internal storage at first.
```bash
➜ adb push test.apk /data/local/tmp/
```
- After that, install an apk into work profile.
```bash
➜ adb shell pm install -t --user 10 /data/local/tmp/test.apk
```

**Pull files/APK from work profile with ADB**
- Locate into APK directory
```bash
➜ adb shell pm path --user 10 com.twitter.android
```
- Pull an APK. Here we don't need to specify an user once we got its full path
```bash
➜ adb pull /data/app/~~LIZadsddbhnwGmi8rQ==/com.twitter.android-oCM-tTVHsdddc8IxZ66A==/base.apk
```

**Start an android activity with ADB**
```bash
➜ adb shell am start --user 10 -n "com.twitter.android/com.twitter.android.MainActivity"
```
- Same process for broadcast receievrs, services and content providers as well.

## Work Profile and Frida
- Download and install latest frida server on Android
```bash
➜ adb root # might be required
➜ adb push frida-server /data/local/tmp/
➜ adb shell "chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/frida-server"
➜ adb shell "/data/local/tmp/frida-server &"
```
- By default, frida uses default user ID (which is 0) after running a server.
- Therefore while hooking up and application, it cannot find the application installed on work profile.
- We can also add these custom codes on Source Code of Frida Server and Compile it to install it into device. Here the `userid` is hardcoded to use 10 i.e. work profile. But it may arise a problem when you need to hook the application installed on default user id. You need to reconfigure the file to use user ID as 0 again. [Reference](https://github.com/frida/frida/issues/1353#issuecomment-648261281)
```JS
var userSpecific = true;
if (!userSpecific) {
 performLaunchOperation(pkg, function () {
  context.startActivity(intent);
 });
}else{
performLaunchOperation(pkg, function () {
  var userid = 10;
  var ContextWrapper = Java.use('android.content.ContextWrapper');
  var UserHandle = Java.use('android.os.UserHandle');
  var userHandle = UserHandle.of(userid);
  context = ContextWrapper.$new(context);
  context.startActivityAsUser(intent,userHandle);
 });
}
```
- After some research, I found that Frida has added an option to manage `Auxiliary Parameters` which will provide platform-specific spawn options on the command.

</p>

- Digging into it, we can see that it first check whether the user ID is 0 or not and when the user ID is not 0, it searches for the package name installed on the supplied user ID/profile i.e. user ID 10 in my case.

</p>

- Which means we can hook an application using commands `--aux "uid=(int)10"`
```bash
➜ frida -U -f com.twitter.android --aux "uid=(int)10"

## Random Thoughts 
- By injecting the frida/objection snippet, we might also be able to hook into an application that is installed on the work profile. Since the application executes in a work environment, this could trigger a frida server to use the work profile. But need give it a shot. Maybe after a while.
